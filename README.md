# BowlingBot
This program is a bot I built using python, for a Bowling game availble at https://www.crazygames.com/game/the-bowling-club and on facebook games as well.
## Steps
0. Install python's pyautogui using pip or conda from the cmd or anaconda terminal respectively.
1. Clone this repo to your PC and extract the zip file. (Note the picture shall be used to get the coordinates.)(Note:I'm using os import so you wont have to find path of any file) I made this for windows, I'm not sure if directory paths are different in other operating systems.
2. Go to the website and start the game.
3. Run the script, and as soon as you run it go back to the game within 7 seconds. Since I shall be using the clicking function to move the ball assuming you are on the game.
